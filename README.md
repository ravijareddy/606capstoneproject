# Sentiment Analysis and Content-Based Recommendation System

## Overview

This project combines Sentiment Analysis and a Content-Based Recommendation System to analyze text data and recommend items based on user preferences. Using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, the system processes textual content to extract sentiments and generate meaningful recommendations.

Features

## Sentiment Analysis:

Implements models like VADER, BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and ALBERT.

Identifies positive, negative, and neutral sentiments in text data.

Evaluates and compares model performance to select the most accurate one.

## Content-Based Recommendation System:

Uses item attributes (e.g., keywords, descriptions) to compute similarity between items.

Recommends top-N items based on user interactions.

Employs techniques like TF-IDF and cosine similarity for feature extraction and similarity calculation.

Workflow

## Data Preprocessing:

Clean text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters.

Convert text into numerical formats using TF-IDF or embeddings.

## Sentiment Analysis:

Apply multiple models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) to determine sentiment scores.

Compare model outputs using evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

Select the best-performing model for sentiment predictions.

## Content Recommendation:

Build a similarity matrix using item attributes.

Use cosine similarity to find the most relevant items.

Generate recommendations based on user preferences or query input.

## Evaluation:

Measure sentiment analysis performance using metrics like F1-score.

Validate recommendations with metrics like precision, recall, and coverage.

Models Used
